# Taks 2 

I encountered a lot of problems with building the application, as my primary programming language is python, so the Javascript / Typescript was definitely a challenge.

I managed to build the application and deploy it manually, and you can find it here:

CloudFront distribution:  https://d32l2wb1rxd4ux.cloudfront.net/

However, I encountered some problems with automated deployment using CDK. I managed to deploy it with CDK to S3 bucket, but there is some missmatch with permissions.
